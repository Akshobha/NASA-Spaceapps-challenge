# NASA-Spaceapps-challenge
Hello everyone, this is a repo containing my model pt file.
I wrote a ML pipeline which leverages this github repo for training a model for exoplanet classification.
Here are some guidelines you need to follow while using my code:
1. Make sure that git for desktop is installed in your device.
2. Device runs on windows as my code saves its results in a devices C disk.
3. Your device should have python installed and it should have Gitpython, Scikit-learn, Pytorch, Pandas and Numpy installed.
4. You should delete your local repo of this everytime you use this prototype as this is a bug I'm not able to fix.
5. Make sure your device is plugged in for optimal performance as this prototype runs a FNN model locally on your device.
6. Follow the instructions given in my apps UI.

Thank you for using my code and I hope you enjoyed using as much as I enjoyed developing it!
